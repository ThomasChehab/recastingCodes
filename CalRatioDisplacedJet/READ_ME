This code has been written using the version python 3.8.8.

To process the recasting, please follow these instructions :

- Clone this repository by typing in a terminal :

git clone git@github.com:ThomasChehab/recastingCodes.git 

- Install this version of MadGraph : MG5_aMC_v3.4.2.tar.gz from : https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/+download

- Extract the tarball.

- In the MG5_aMC_v3_4_2 folder, download and place the model named : HAHM_MG5model_v3 from https://github.com/davidrcurtin/HAHM.

- Launch MadGraph by writing, in a terminal (opened in the MG5_aMC_v3_4_2 folder) : ./bin/mg5_aMC

- After entering the MadGraph terminal, install LHAPDF6 and Pythia8 by writing :

MG5_aMC> install lhapdf6

And after :

MG5_aMC> install pythia8

It will take several minutes each.

- You will also need to convert the model file by writing :

MG5_aMC> convert model HAHM_MG5model_v3/HAHM_MG5model_v3/HAHM_variableMW_v3_UFO

MadGraph is now ready to generate events on your computer ! Please be sure that everything you downloaded from the GitHub repository is in the MG5_aMC_v3_4_2 folder.

- Now, you can generate the scripts that MadGraph will read by launching the function Writing_Scripts_MG+P8.py in the terminal with :

python3 Writing_Scripts_MG+P8.py

It will write five scripts and launch the associated MadGraph generation. This generation is long. After approximately 1h40-2h of running, all files should be ready.

- To process the data and obtain plots and limits, you can now launch in the terminal :

python3 Computation_Map.py

It will also be long ( more than 2h ) and at the end, you will have the plots, the limits and the values in a text files, so that you do not have to redo the entire run.
